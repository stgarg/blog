Write your content here.

Guidelines:
- File lives in `_blog/` with any simple slug name: `my-idea.md`
- If you include `date:`, sorting uses it; otherwise fallback is build order.
- Keep titles short; the sidebar shows the exact `title:`.

Examples:

Inline code: `fn(x)`  
Block:
```
print("hello world")
```

Links: [Example](https://example.com)

Lists:
- point one
- point two

Enjoy.
