title: First Post Placeholder
# Optional: date: 2025-09-26
---

This is your first post using the undated collection. You can:

- Rename this file (keep the `.md` extension) â€“ the URL becomes `/blog/<filename>/`.
- Optionally add a `date:` field for ordering (ISO format recommended: `YYYY-MM-DD`).
- Write Markdown freely.

Next steps idea:
> Replace this placeholder with a short note about why you started the site or what you plan to publish.

Happy writing.
